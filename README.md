# HostingBot.net API Wrapper

## Installation

```bash
npm install hostingbot.net --save
```

## Why use this module?
Personally I've been a customer of hostingbot.net for awhile now and I've seen how people love to integrate APIs with their bot. Using their hosting provider's API allows for rich information to be easily accessed. 
### Speed
I've done my best to try and optimize this module for speed. Currently, the HostingBot API is not the fastest so I've done some nice tricks to get past that and deliver content secure and fast.


## Usage

```js
const HostingBot = require("hostingbot.net"); // REQUIRE THE MODULE
const credentials = { // Don't be like me, have these values in a protected file.
      apiKey: "hostingbot-apiKey", // API Key from hostingbot.net
      apiPass: "hostingbot-apiPass", // API pass from hostingbot.net
      svs: 69 // Secure Virtual Server ID from hostingbot.net
};
const VPS = new HostingBot.VPS(credentials); // Used for general VPS Actions.
const Statistics = VPS.getBandwidth(); // Returns a promise object
console.log(Statistics); 
// {
//   bandwidth: {
//     limit: 4000,
//     used: 23.14
//   },
//   month: {
//     yr: '2020',
//     month: '10',
//     mth_txt: '20 Oct 2020\n19 Nov 2020',
//     days: '31'
//   }
// }
const Account = new HostingBot.Account(credentials); // Used for general account actions. 
const myAccount = Account.fetch(); // Fetches directly from the HostingBot API due to a acceptable speed. 
console.log(myAccount)
// {
//    "fname":"Romvnly",
//    "lname":"Gaming",
//    "language":"english",
//    "email":"romvnlybusiness@gmail.com",
//    "uid":24
// }
```
## Get API Information

Go to the Client Area in hostingbot.net 
[![HostingBot Client Area](https://github.com/Romvnly-Gaming/hostingbot.net/blob/main/images/client-area.png)](https://clients.hostingbot.net/aff.php?aff=8)

And then from the virtualizor dashboard, get your Virtual Private Server's ID. This is your 'svs' that we use to fetch from the HostingBot API.
[![HostingBot Virtualizor](https://github.com/Romvnly-Gaming/hostingbot.net/blob/main/images/dashboard.png)](https://clients.hostingbot.net/aff.php?aff=8)

Now, you need to create a API key pair as they're not generated by HostingBot.net automatically for security.

And boom, you've created a API user! Please make sure to keep all your credentials safe, if you ever lose them, you should REVOKE them from the virtualizor dashboard.
